# Bootcamper App Roadmap: Habit-Forming, Motivation, and Progress Features

## 1. Habit-Forming Features

  - Track and display how many days in a row the user has checked in.
  - Reward streaks with badges or encouraging messages.
- **Reminders:**
  - Email or push notifications for daily check-ins.
- **Quick Check-In:**
  - Allow users to log a “done” with one click, even if they skip the full routine.

## 2. Motivation Features
- **Rank Progress Bar:**
  - Visualize progress to the next rank.
- **Achievements/Badges:**
  - Award badges for milestones (e.g., 7-day streak, first feedback, etc.).
- **Personal Bests:**
  - Highlight when a user sets a new record (e.g., best mood, most consistent week).
- **Motivational Messages:**
  - Rotate through encouraging quotes or tips.

## 3. Progress Tracking
- **Graphs:**

- **Routine History:**
  - Allow users to review and compare past routines.
- **Goal Tracking:**
  - Let users set and track specific goals (e.g., “Run 5km”, “Lose 3kg”).
- **Export Data:**
  - Allow users to download their history as CSV or connect to Google Sheets.

## 4. Community & Social (Optional for MVP)

## Suggested Next Steps for MVP
1. Deploy your app (Streamlit Cloud or similar) and test with real users.
2. Collect feedback on the core experience.
3. Add streaks, reminders, and a simple progress graph as your first habit-forming features.
4. Iterate based on user feedback before building more advanced features.
